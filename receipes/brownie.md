Introducing: Triple-Chocolate Hazelnut Bliss Brownies

These brownies are a divine indulgence, surpassing all expectations with their chewy texture, crackly top, and an irresistible blend of three luscious chocolates. But here's the twist that will elevate your brownie experience to new heights—enter the world of hazelnuts. This unique twist adds a delightful crunch and a rich, nutty flavor that perfectly complements the triple-chocolate goodness.

Ingredients:
- Nonstick vegetable oil spray or unsalted butter, for preparing the baking pan
- 62g (½ cup) all-purpose flour
- 50g (½ cup) Dutch-process cocoa powder (such as Guittard cocoa rouge)
- 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt
- ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
- 113g (4 oz.) bittersweet chocolate, preferably 70%, broken into pieces
- 250g (1¼ cups) granulated sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract
- 113g (4 oz.) semisweet chocolate chips
- ½ cup chopped hazelnuts, toasted

Preparation:

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly coat a metal 8x8" baking pan with nonstick vegetable oil spray or unsalted butter. Line the pan with parchment paper, leaving generous overhang on two sides, and lightly coat the parchment with nonstick spray.

2. In a small bowl, whisk together 62g all-purpose flour, 50g cocoa powder, and 1½ tsp. salt to combine.

3. In a medium metal bowl set over a large saucepan of barely simmering water, melt ½ cup unsalted butter and 113g bittersweet chocolate (preferably 70%), stirring occasionally until smooth (about 5 minutes).

4. Whisk in 250g granulated sugar, then add 3 large eggs one at a time, whisking vigorously between additions. Once all eggs are incorporated, continue to whisk for 1 minute more. Remove the bowl from heat and whisk in 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract, then whisk in the dry ingredients.

5. Using a rubber spatula, gently stir in 113g semisweet chocolate chips and ½ cup chopped hazelnuts. Scrape the decadent batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the surface.

6. Bake the brownies until set across the top and a tester inserted into the center comes out with just a few moist crumbs attached, approximately 27–30 minutes.

7. Allow the brownies to cool in the pan for at least 30 minutes, preferably in the refrigerator, before cutting into 12 delectable pieces.

These Triple-Chocolate Hazelnut Bliss Brownies can be prepared in advance, as they can be baked up to 4 days ahead. Simply store them tightly wrapped at room temperature for a divine treat whenever your sweet tooth calls.
