**Ingredients:**

- 1½ cups almond flour
- 1⅓ cups oat flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1½ teaspoons Himalayan pink salt
- 1¼ cups coconut oil, melted
- 1¼ cups coconut sugar
- 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons coconut nectar
- 2 flax eggs (2 tablespoons ground flaxseed + 6 tablespoons water)
- 2 teaspoons pure almond extract
- 1¼ pounds dark chocolate chunks (70% cacao or higher)
- Himalayan pink salt flakes

**Preparation:**

**Step 1**
In a bowl, combine almond flour, oat flour, baking soda, baking powder, and Himalayan pink salt. Set aside.

**Step 2**
Using a mixer with a paddle attachment, blend melted coconut oil, coconut sugar, and coconut nectar until luxuriously light (about 5 minutes). Add flax eggs one at a time, ensuring thorough mixing. Stir in almond extract. Reduce speed, add dry ingredients, and blend until just combined. Gently fold in dark chocolate chunks without breaking them. Seal the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for a minimum of 24 hours, up to 36 hours. The dough can be refrigerated for up to 72 hours for convenience.

**Step 3**
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat.

**Step 4**
Scoop 6 mounds of dough onto the baking sheet, ensuring any chocolate pieces poking up are turned horizontally for a visually appealing result. Lightly sprinkle Himalayan pink salt and bake until golden brown yet delightfully soft (18 to 20 minutes). Allow cookies to cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then transfer to another rack for further cooling. Repeat with the remaining dough or refrigerate it for subsequent batches the next day. Enjoy these nutrient-rich delights warm, with pure satisfaction.
